				<p>
				Trivium is a heavy metal band from Orlando, Florida that formed in 1999. They have four members and have a whopping 9 albums. The bands name is Latin for a 3 way intersection, which is the way they described their music as melodic death metal, metalcore and thrash metal. They formed after an eigth grade talent show. They have had numerous members along the way but are still going strong. According to Zeb anything other then Shogun as the best album by Trivium is wrong and he is willing to die on that hill. Personally I find that all of the albums have a unique sound to them that gets me to come back and check what they are doing every now and then. Shogun is the best album though....
